# Linux-Expect-Script

- You have scenario where you need to login to registy

```
method 1:
----------
podman login docker-eu.artifactory.vijay.com/vijay-docker-local
username:
password:
- here it will ask username and password, but the thing is it will save your credentials.
  Credentials will be cached in memory or managed by Podmanâ€™s internal mechanisms.
  so for next login sessions it won't prompt you for username and password untill token expires.

method 2:
---------
ARTI_USER=vijay
ARTI_PASS=xxxx
ARTI_SERVER=docker-eu.artifactory.vijay.com/vijay-docker-local

podman login -u "$ARTI_USER" -p "$ARTI_PASS" "$ARTI_SERVER"



root@jenkins-master1:~# podman login -u "$ARTI_USER" -p "$ARTI_PASS" "$ARTI_SERVER"
Login Succeeded!

root@jenkins-master1:~# podman login docker-eu.artifactory.vijay.com/vijay-docker-local
Authenticating with existing credentials for docker-eu.artifactory.vijay.com/vijay-docker-local
Existing credentials are valid. Already logged in to docker-eu.artifactory.vijay.com/vijay-docker-local
```

- first method is interactive/manual way
- second method is automated way

- But if you ran into a situation where you need to surely use first method, but in a automated way of passing username and password, then we can go for expect script


```
sudo apt-get install expect

touch script-expect.sh
chmod +x script-expect.sh
vi script-expect.sh

```

```
#!/usr/bin/expect -f

set timeout -1
set timeout -1
set username "vijay"
set password "xxxxx"
set registry "docker-eu.artifactory.vijay.com/vijay-docker-local"

spawn sudo podman login $registry
expect "Username:"
send "$username\r"
expect "Password:"
send "$password\r"
expect eof

```

```
./script-expect.sh
```


- exception Handle


  
```
#!/usr/bin/expect -f
set timeout -1
set username "vijay"
set password "xxxxx"
set registry "docker-eu.artifactory.vijay.com/vijay-docker-local"

spawn sudo podman login $registry
expect {
    "Username:" {
        send "$username\r"
        exp_continue
    }
    "Password:" {
        send "$password\r"
        exp_continue
    }
    "Login Succeeded!" {
        # If login succeeded, exit successfully
        exit
    }
    "Already logged in" {
        # If already logged in, exit successfully
        exit
    }
    timeout {
        # If there's a timeout, exit with an error
        exit 1
    }
}

```
